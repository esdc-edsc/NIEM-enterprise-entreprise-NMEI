		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">National Occupational Classification</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Overview</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The National Occupational Classification (NOC) is a system
			for describing the occupations of Canadians. It gives statisticians, labour market
			analysts, career counsellors, employers and individual job seekers a standardized way of
			describing and understanding the nature of work. The system includes a series of
			publications that help these people to organize and use statistics and other labour
			market facts.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">History</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The NOC was implemented in 1991/92 as a replacement for the
			Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO). It was created through an
			extensive program of research, collecting information from employers, workers, educators
			and associations. Analyses and consultations were also conducted with providers and
			users of labour market data across the country. Employment and Social Development Canada
			(ESDC) worked closely with Statistics Canada to ensure strong links between the NOC and
			Statistics Canada's Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), for the collection and
			publication of labour market data.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The first revised edition of the NOC, NOC 2001, replaced the
			original publication and the parallel 1991 SOC produced by Statistics Canada. The
			revised SOC was then replaced with the National Occupational Classification for
			Statistics (NOC-S). The NOC 2001 and the NOC-S filled the gaps that were identified as
			shortcomings of the 1992 NOC. These included a missing technical level for information
			technology occupations, inconsistencies in relation to the statistical structure and the
			challenges in capturing the emergence of new work methods and new titles used in the
			labour market. The NOC 2001, while conservative with respect to structural change,
			reflected the evolution of occupations over the decade between 1991 and 2001 in
			Canada.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The NOC is updated on a regular basis through ongoing
			research and modifications to content are published on a regular basis. Historically,
			the NOC was revised to coincide with Census cycles. The NOC 2011, published to coincide
			with Census 2011, represented a major structural revision unifying the NOC and the
			NOC-S. Significant content and structural revisions affecting the coding system were
			implemented. The 2016 edition of the NOC reflects changes in content but maintains the
			same structure as the NOC 2011.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The goal of the NOC is to make it easier for users at all
			levels to achieve a better understanding of work in the Canadian labour market. The
			Occupational Descriptions provide formal descriptions of 500 occupational groups. These
			descriptions are identified by codes and titles organized in a four-level numerical
			hierarchy.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The NOC ensures that labour market statistics are collected
			and assembled in a standard way that will be meaningful to users. At the same time, the
			descriptions allow technical users, such as economists and business analysts, to
			understand exactly what the statistics mean.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Applications</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The NOC provides a standardized language for describing the
			work performed by Canadians. It is used at all stages of the process from defining and
			collecting data, to managing information databases, to analyzing labour market trends
			and extracting practical career planning information.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">By providing a standard way of organizing occupational
			information, the NOC also supports a variety of career information resources published
			by the Government of Canada and others. For example, information on occupational
			outlooks, the national Job Bank listing of jobs available across Canada, and dynamic
			labour market information are all organized according to the structure of the
			NOC.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Data Collection</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The hierarchical coding structure of the NOC is used in the
			collection of occupational information. For example, economists and statisticians use
			the NOC to guide the collection and compilation of data. The Government of Canada uses
			it for the analysis of occupational data collected from the Census, Labour Force Survey
			and other surveys.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The NOC is also used for a variety of special surveys with
			respect to labour mobility, technological change, administrative data and other
			indicators of labour market activity. In addition, provincial governments and private
			survey companies use the NOC to ensure that the information they collect will be
			directly comparable to data they get from other sources.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Labour Market Analysis</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Labour market researchers use the NOC to understand the
			underpinnings of the statistics they use, and more importantly, to interpret them
			correctly. The NOC provides the context for the interpretation of statistical
			information. These users analyze the Canadian labour market to understand emerging
			trends, to guide policy decisions and to develop systems for training, recruiting and
			job matching. National, regional and local labour market information can be accessed by
			visiting Job Bank (www.jobbank.gc.ca).</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Labour market analyses include work done within the
			government to set policy and improve labour market efficiency. For example, all levels
			of government use this type of analysis to allocate spending for labour market programs,
			to manage systems for matching jobs with workers who have the required skills, and for
			immigration selection procedures.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Career Planning and Job Seeking</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Career developers, counsellors and students use the NOC and
			related resources such as the Career Handbook for career planning and exploration
			purposes. An understanding of occupational definitions, employment requirements and
			opportunities is central to the goal of matching the interests and aptitudes of
			individuals to the requirements and opportunities associated with
			occupations.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Job seekers, employment counsellors and employers rely on
			the NOC to make effective use of labour market information services provided by the
			government, organizations and stakeholders. Job Bank offers a free and bilingual job
			website and job matching service which provides timely and relevant labour market
			information on employment opportunities across Canada and allows employers to post
			available job opportunities and job seekers to search for jobs.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Exploring the NOC</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">In a nutshell, the NOC is a tool that is used to classify
			occupations according to their Skill Level and Skill Type. A four-digit code, called the
			"NOC code", identifies the occupation. Each digit of this code reflects an important
			trait of the occupation it represents.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Let's begin by looking at each digit and the significance it
			has with respect to the NOC.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Skill Type</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Skill Type is the broadest occupational category and is
			based on the type of work performed. It also reflects the field of training or
			experience that is normally required for entry into occupations. This includes the
			educational area of study required, as well as the industry of employment in cases where
			experience within an internal job ladder is required for entry. These categories are
			intended to indicate easily understood segments of the world of work.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The first digit of the NOC code designates the Skill Type.
			For example, Occupations in manufacturing and utilities start with the digit 9.
			Management Occupations, which are found across all Skill Types, start with the digit
			0.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Skill Level</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">In the context of the NOC, Skill Level corresponds to the
			type and/or amount of training or education typically required to work in an occupation.
			The NOC consists of four Skill Levels identified A through D with each level assigned
			one of two numerical codes ranging from 0 to 7. To illustrate this concept, have a look
			at the chart below to see the relationship between the alphabetical indicator of each
			Skill Level and its accompanying numerical digits.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Skill Level is primarily based on the nature of education
			and training required to enter an occupation. This criterion also reflects the
			experience required and the complexity of the responsibilities involved in the work,
			compared with other occupations. In most cases, progression to Skill Level A, from B, is
			not usually possible without completion of additional formal education, whereas
			progression from Skill Level D to Skill Level C is often achievable through on-the-job
			training and experience.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Each Skill Level is intended to reflect commonly accepted
			paths to employment in an occupation. Where there are several paths to employment, the
			Skill Level most commonly identified by employers is used, considering the context of
			the occupation and the trends in hiring requirements.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The second digit of the NOC code represents the Skill Level
			for all occupations, with the exception of Management which will be discussed
			below.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Management Occupations</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Management occupations classified as Skill Type 0, span all
			other Skill Types from 1 through 9 of the classification structure, and are found in all
			areas of the labour market. All NOC codes that begin with a zero represent management
			occupations. When the second digit is also zero, this represents "senior" management
			occupations. To identify all other management occupations, the second digit (1 through
			9) corresponds to management within each Skill Type.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">To illustrate this concept, let us look at the
			following:</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• Management occupations in sales and services begin with
			06. The 0 indicates that it is a management level occupation and the 6 indicates that
			the occupation falls under the Sales and Service Skill Type.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• Now consider a NOC code that has a zero as its first and
			second digit. Similar to the example above, we know that this occupation is a management
			occupation because it begins with zero. We also know that the second digit for
			management occupations reflects the Skill Type. However, because there is no Skill Type
			0, we can conclude that this is a senior management occupation.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Management occupations are at the top of all organizational
			hierarchies. These occupations are characterized by high levels of responsibility and
			are also included in Skill Level A.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Major Groups</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Major groups follow the broadest categorization of
			occupations and are identified by the first two digits of a NOC code. It is a roll-up,
			or, an aggregation of minor groups (which we will look at shortly).</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Minor Groups</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The major groups are further divided at the three-digit
			level, into 140 minor groups.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">By now you have probably realized that each digit of the NOC
			code helps to further specify an occupation. At the minor group level, you can pinpoint
			a domain in which an occupation is carried out. However, we need to go one step further
			to identify an actual occupational group.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Unit Groups</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">At the detailed four-digit level, the system is expanded
			into 500 occupational groups identified as unit groups, each with a unique code. Unit
			groups represent further specificity within an occupational domain.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">You have now learned about the structure of the NOC and how
			codes are related to Skill Type and Skill Level. The question now is: how do you find
			these codes and use them in practical terms? This will be addressed in the following
			section, which will introduce you to the NOC tools that you can use to code and describe
			occupations. We will begin by looking at the Occupational Descriptions that contain all
			of the information that you need to code occupations.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Occupational Descriptions</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Whether you are an economist analyzing labour market data
			for a specific occupation or an employment counsellor helping someone determine what
			type of training to take, occupational descriptions help us understand an occupation
			using a standardized language.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Occupational descriptions have been developed for each of
			the 500 unit groups included in the NOC. Each description is referred to as an "NOC
			group". Each description includes the following elements:</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Lead Statement</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The lead statement provides a general description of the
			occupation and the boundaries of the unit group. It also indicates the kinds of
			industries, workplaces or establishments where the occupation is
			found.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Example Titles</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Example titles are the occupational titles commonly found
			within the group. This list is an extraction of a more expansive listing of alphabetical
			job titles found in the NOC Index of Titles.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Main Duties</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The main duties section describes the most significant
			duties of the occupations in the group. It may include:</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• type and level of education including specific subject
			matter if relevant, starting with the lowest possible requirement for entry into the
			occupation;</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• two or more sub-sets of occupations with statements that
			apply to each sub-set or component; and/or</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• a series of brief statements that are linked to specific
			occupations, that, while similar enough to be in the same group, can be described
			separately.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Statements in Italics, at the end of this section, identify
			a specialization that may exist within the occupation.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Employment Requirements</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Employment requirements are prerequisites generally needed
			to enter the occupation. Several types of requirements are listed:</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• type and level of education including specific subject
			matter if relevant, starting with the lowest possible requirement for entry into the
			occupation;</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• specific training required, including apprenticeship,
			on-the-job or internal training;</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• experience in a related occupation, especially for
			supervisory or managerial occupations;</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• licences, certificates or affiliations;
			and/or</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• other requirements not dependent on formal education, such
			as athletic abilities, artistic talent or presentation of a
			portfolio.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">While some occupations have very specific employment
			requirements, others have a wide range of acceptable requirements. The following
			terminology is used to indicate the level of the requirement:</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• "Is required" indicates a definite
			requirement.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• "Is usually required" means that the qualification is
			generally expressed as required by a majority of employers, but not always
			mandatory.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• "May be required" describes requirements that some
			employers may impose, but are not universal.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Qualities related to personal suitability that may have an
			impact on employability are not described in the classification. These factors are
			subjective and determined by employers and assessed during the hiring
			process.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Additional Information</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Some descriptions include additional information to give
			details on:</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• mobility patterns;</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• progression to supervisory positions, specializations or
			to other occupations such as management;</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• other information that may clarify the occupational
			description.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Exclusion</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Exclusion section helps to clarify the boundaries of the
			unit group by identifying similar groups or related occupations, such as supervisory
			groups, that are separately classified.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Matrix</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">A chart called the NOC Matrix illustrates the Major and the
			Minor groups, and the relationship between Skill Types and Skill Levels. This provides
			an overview of the entire classification structure.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Skill Types are represented in the columns while the Skill
			Levels are found in rows. Managerial occupations are found in the top portion of the
			chart, indicating the presence of management across all segments of the labour
			market.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">While the Matrix can be helpful in identifying Major and
			Minor Groups, it does not identify Unit Groups due to space
			limitations.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Index of Titles</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">As useful as the unit group headings or labels are, they do
			not always correspond with the real-world job titles in use every day. For this reason,
			the Index of Titles is a tool used to search for occupational titles in addition to
			those that appear in the occupational descriptions.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Scope of the Index of Titles</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Index of Titles contains thousands of titles classified
			within the 500 occupational groups of the NOC. With millions of people in the employed
			labour force, it is impossible to capture all of the individualized job titles that
			could potentially exist. While the listing in the Index is not meant to be exhaustive,
			it does provide extensive coverage of commonly used and understood titles in the
			economy, as well as the more obscure and specific titles found in many occupational
			areas. Some of the more commonly used titles in an occupation are listed as examples
			within each NOC unit group description.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">To assist users, the Index includes both formally recognized
			occupational titles (e.g., radiography technologist) and less formal titles that are
			commonly used (e.g., X-ray technician). Some titles represent occupations (e.g.,
			librarian; chef), while other titles refer to specializations within an occupation
			(e.g., music librarian; pastry chef). Still, others correspond to a range of jobs (e.g.,
			furniture assembler; sawmill machine operator).</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Modifiers</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Industry, institution or subject matter modifiers are added
			to many titles. This information is attached to the title following a dash (e.g.,
			customer service supervisor - retail; electronics mechanic - avionics) to provide a
			means of differentiation among titles. Often, the extensions provide further information
			to clarify the placement of titles in the classification structure (e.g., painter -
			visual arts; painter - motor vehicle manufacturing). These modifiers should be
			considered when coding an occupational title.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Military Titles</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Prior to the 2011 revision, titles of military occupations
			were indicated by adding the modifier military after a dash (e.g., sonar technician -
			military). Military occupations are now classified according to rank. These titles are
			now found within the unit groups for either the commissioned ranks or non-commissioned
			ranks of the armed forces.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Concordance Between Languages</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The terminological research conducted for the translation
			and adaptation of the titles contained in this revised Index of Titles has dealt with a
			component that was not previously addressed. Concordances for all titles in both
			official languages have been identified. The level of concordance identifies
			correspondence between one title (or several where there are equivalent titles) to one
			or many titles in the other language.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Career Handbook</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Purpose</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Finding understandable information about the entire world of
			work and how it is organized can be difficult. The purpose of the Career Handbook is to
			provide useful, reliable and accessible information about occupations to counsellors and
			their clients.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Career Handbook has been developed by occupational
			researchers, analysts and trained raters. The ratings assigned to each group are global
			and describe the occupation with respect to skills and other variables to provide
			important indicators for career exploration. The Handbook will help counsellors and
			their clients investigate occupations and make informed career
			decisions.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Career Handbook is intended for career counselling,
			development and exploration purposes. ESDC neither condones nor recommends the use of
			this information for other purposes. The profiles presented here are not appropriate for
			other uses such as screening applicants for particular positions or determining
			insurance benefits. The data do not replace the use of criterion-referenced testing to
			establish performance requirements for work as it occurs in the labour market. There are
			three major reasons for this limitation:</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• The conceptual foundation of the NOC and the Handbook is
			occupations, not jobs. An occupation is a collection of similar jobs that share some or
			all of a set of Main Duties. The tasks of specific jobs vary from establishment to
			establishment.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• The rated information in the Handbook is not based on
			experimental data collected from representative samples of the employed labour force for
			the occupations of the NOC.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• Development of the NOC and the Handbook did not include
			the collection of data on specific working conditions for jobs contained within
			occupational groups of the NOC.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Occupation Code, Title and Introductory</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The occupation code appears at the top of both pages of an
			entry. It is either identical to the four-digit NOC unit group code, or it has a digit
			added after a decimal identifying it as a subgroup of the original NOC unit
			group.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The title of the group follows the code on the first page.
			The titles are either those of the original NOC unit group or are taken from the Main
			Duties subgroup descriptions.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The introductory statement, which provides a general
			overview of the occupation, is taken from the lead statement of the NOC unit group. When
			there are subgroups, this same pattern is followed.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Data/Information, People, Things</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">This section identifies all the ratings in an abbreviated
			alphanumeric format, providing counsellors with a quick overview of the nature of the
			occupation.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">A Synopsis of Descriptors and Labels as well as Descriptor
			Definitions provide detailed information on the factor ratings, their labels and
			levels.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Examples of Job Titles</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The NOC and the Career Handbook do not provide an exhaustive
			list of job titles. The list provided in the group indicates the most commonly used
			titles in an occupation across the country. This list also presents a conceptual
			boundary around an occupation by identifying the range of job titles contained within a
			group.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Main Characteristics</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Descriptor Profile provides, in narrative form, the Main
			Characteristics of an occupation by describing its predominant n, interest and
			functional elements.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Descriptor Profile highlights the aptitudes most
			relevant in the performance of the work. They are based on the same theoretical
			principles and level configuration as that of the predecessor of the NOC, the Canadian
			Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO), Volume 2. Aptitude ratings are
			further discussed in the Descriptor Definitions and Rating Methodology
			sections.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The interests for the occupation are assigned in order of
			predominance. Interests are based on the Canadian Work Preference Inventory (CWPI). They
			are highlighted, along with worker functions (Data/People/Things - DPT) as further
			qualifiers, to describe the involvement that a worker in the occupation will have with
			data/information, people and things. DPT is adopted from the scales used in the
			CCDO.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">This interpretative narrative is based on the Main Duties
			section of the NOC unit group descriptions as well as on the assigned ratings for the
			above-mentioned scales. For some groups derived from NOC subgroups with little
			information, research, secondary sources and the CCDO were used to provide additional
			narrative content. The CCDO information is generally from Volume 2, which identifies
			skills rather than specific job tasks.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Physical Activities Environmental
			Conditions</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Physical Activities and Environmental Conditions scales
			follow the Main Characteristics. Refer to the Remarks section for the explanation of
			asterisks (*) used in both these scales.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Since there is no direct link between the ratings in these
			sections and the content presented in the NOC’s Main Duties, it was not possible to
			incorporate them into the narrative. However, they are an integral part of the
			Descriptor Profile for the occupation and provide important information for counsellor
			use.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The ratings for Physical Activities factors in an
			occupational profile do not indicate that persons with disabilities can or cannot
			perform the duties of that occupation. However, counsellors of clients with disabilities
			may find the information useful in terms of considering workplace accommodations that
			would enhance their client’s employability.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Employment Requirements</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">In this section, the employment requirements from the NOC
			unit group are assigned indicators to provide a numerical reference for counsellors. The
			Education/Training Indicators identify a hierarchical order for types of education and
			training, and also incorporate two other criteria represented by "+" and "R" where
			applicable. These symbols indicate that requirements other than education and training
			are relevant for the occupation.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Occupational Options</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">For most occupations there is some form of mobility such as
			transferability, lateral mobility, upward progression and specialization. Although these
			patterns of mobility are different, their presence indicates that there are skills or
			competencies that can be adapted from one occupation and applied to another. This
			section identifies the possibility for worker mobility within the group or the potential
			to move to other occupations.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Remarks</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Remarks section provides free-standing comments as well
			as statements for Physical Activities and Environmental Conditions ratings that appear
			with an asterisk (*). Free-standing comments, which precede statements about ratings,
			usually provide information related to specializations for an
			occupation.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">An asterisk for a Physical Activity rating will appear after
			that rating. There are no asterisks under Physical Activities in the sample group –
			2212.1 Geological and Mineral Technologists. However, if an asterisk appeared beside
			Strength 2 Light, it would affect the meaning of the rating. Strength 2 Light –
			indicates that Strength for the occupational group as a whole is 2, which has the label
			Light. The presence of an asterisk would indicate that some jobs within the group have a
			rating of 3, which is labelled Medium. In general, an asterisk for Physical Activities
			indicates a level up for the rating.</xs:documentation>
		<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">For Environmental Conditions, an asterisk indicates that the
			potential condition in a group is limited to some jobs, not the occupation as a whole.
			For example, in 2212.1 Geological and Mineral Technologists, the asterisk for Hazards
			H8* Dangerous locations – indicates that this is a potential hazard for some but not all
			jobs within the group.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The National Occupational Classification (NOC) is a
				system for describing the occupations of Canadians. It gives statisticians, labour
				market analysts, career counsellors, employers and individual job seekers a
				standardized way of describing and understanding the nature of work. The system
				includes a series of publications that help these people to organize and use
				statistics and other labour market facts.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Exploring the NOC</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">In a nutshell, the NOC is a tool that is used to
				classify occupations according to their Skill Level and Skill Type. A four-digit
				code, called the "NOC code", identifies the occupation. Each digit of this code
				reflects an important trait of the occupation it represents.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Let's begin by looking at each digit and the
				significance it has with respect to the NOC.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Skill Type is the broadest occupational category and is
				based on the type of work performed. It also reflects the field of training or
				experience that is normally required for entry into occupations. This includes the
				educational area of study required, as well as the industry of employment in cases
				where experience within an internal job ladder is required for entry. These
				categories are intended to indicate easily understood segments of the world of
				work.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The first digit of the NOC code designates the Skill
				Type. For example, Occupations in manufacturing and utilities start with the digit
				9. Management Occupations, which are found across all Skill Types, start with the
				digit 0.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">In the context of the NOC, Skill Level corresponds to
				the type and/or amount of training or education typically required to work in an
				occupation. The NOC consists of four Skill Levels identified A through D with each
				level assigned one of two numerical codes ranging from 0 to 7. To illustrate this
				concept, have a look at the chart below to see the relationship between the
				alphabetical indicator of each Skill Level and its accompanying numerical
				digits.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Skill Level is primarily based on the nature of
				education and training required to enter an occupation. This criterion also reflects
				the experience required and the complexity of the responsibilities involved in the
				work, compared with other occupations. In most cases, progression to Skill Level A,
				from B, is not usually possible without completion of additional formal education,
				whereas progression from Skill Level D to Skill Level C is often achievable through
				on-the-job training and experience.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Each Skill Level is intended to reflect commonly
				accepted paths to employment in an occupation. Where there are several paths to
				employment, the Skill Level most commonly identified by employers is used,
				considering the context of the occupation and the trends in hiring
				requirements.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The second digit of the NOC code represents the Skill
				Level for all occupations, with the exception of Management which will be discussed
				below.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Management Occupations</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Management occupations classified as Skill Type 0, span
				all other Skill Types from 1 through 9 of the classification structure, and are
				found in all areas of the labour market. All NOC codes that begin with a zero
				represent management occupations. When the second digit is also zero, this
				represents "senior" management occupations. To identify all other management
				occupations, the second digit (1 through 9) corresponds to management within each
				Skill Type.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Management occupations are at the top of all
				organizational hierarchies. These occupations are characterized by high levels of
				responsibility and are also included in Skill Level A.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Major Groups</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Major groups follow the broadest categorization of
				occupations and are identified by the first two digits of a NOC code. It is a
				roll-up, or, an aggregation of minor groups (which we will look at
				shortly).</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Minor Groups</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The major groups are further divided at the three-digit
				level, into 140 minor groups.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">By now you have probably realized that each digit of the
				NOC code helps to further specify an occupation. At the minor group level, you can
				pinpoint a domain in which an occupation is carried out. However, we need to go one
				step further to identify an actual occupational group.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Unit Groups</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">At the detailed four-digit level, the system is expanded
				into 500 occupational groups identified as unit groups, each with a unique code.
				Unit groups represent further specificity within an occupational
				domain.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Index of Titles</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">As useful as the unit group headings or labels are, they
				do not always correspond with the real-world job titles in use every day. For this
				reason, the Index of Titles is a tool used to search for occupational titles in
				addition to those that appear in the occupational descriptions.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Scope of the Index of Titles</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The Index of Titles contains thousands of titles
				classified within the 500 occupational groups of the NOC. With millions of people in
				the employed labour force, it is impossible to capture all of the individualized job
				titles that could potentially exist. While the listing in the Index is not meant to
				be exhaustive, it does provide extensive coverage of commonly used and understood
				titles in the economy, as well as the more obscure and specific titles found in many
				occupational areas. Some of the more commonly used titles in an occupation are
				listed as examples within each NOC unit group description.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">To assist users, the Index includes both formally
				recognized occupational titles (e.g., radiography technologist) and less formal
				titles that are commonly used (e.g., X-ray technician). Some titles represent
				occupations (e.g., librarian; chef), while other titles refer to specializations
				within an occupation (e.g., music librarian; pastry chef). Still, others correspond
				to a range of jobs (e.g., furniture assembler; sawmill machine
				operator).</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Modifiers</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Industry, institution or subject matter modifiers are
				added to many titles. This information is attached to the title following a dash
				(e.g., customer service supervisor - retail; electronics mechanic - avionics) to
				provide a means of differentiation among titles. Often, the extensions provide
				further information to clarify the placement of titles in the classification
				structure (e.g., painter - visual arts; painter - motor vehicle manufacturing).
				These modifiers should be considered when coding an occupational
				title.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Military Titles</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Prior to the 2011 revision, titles of military
				occupations were indicated by adding the modifier military after a dash (e.g., sonar
				technician - military). Military occupations are now classified according to rank.
				These titles are now found within the unit groups for either the commissioned ranks
				or non-commissioned ranks of the armed forces.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Concordance Between Languages</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">The terminological research conducted for the
				translation and adaptation of the titles contained in this revised Index of Titles
				has dealt with a component that was not previously addressed. Concordances for all
				titles in both official languages have been identified. The level of concordance
				identifies correspondence between one title (or several where there are equivalent
				titles) to one or many titles in the other language.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Example Titles</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">Example titles are the occupational titles commonly
				found within the group. This list is an extraction of a more expansive listing of
				alphabetical job titles found in the NOC Index of Titles.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• type and level of education including specific subject
				matter if relevant, starting with the lowest possible requirement for entry into the
				occupation;</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• specific training required, including apprenticeship,
				on-the-job or internal training;</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• experience in a related occupation, especially for

			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• licences, certificates or affiliations;
				and/or</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• other requirements not dependent on formal education,
				such as athletic abilities, artistic talent or presentation of a
				portfolio.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">While some occupations have very specific employment
				requirements, others have a wide range of acceptable requirements. The following
				terminology is used to indicate the level of the requirement:</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• "Is required" indicates a definite
				requirement.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• "Is usually required" means that the qualification is
				generally expressed as required by a majority of employers, but not always
				mandatory.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">• "May be required" describes requirements that some
				employers may impose, but are not universal.</xs:documentation>

				group – 2212.1 Geological and Mineral Technologists. However, if an asterisk
				appeared beside Strength 2 Light, it would affect the meaning of the rating.
				Strength 2 Light – indicates that Strength for the occupational group as a whole is
				2, which has the label Light. The presence of an asterisk would indicate that some
				jobs within the group have a rating of 3, which is labelled Medium. In general, an
				asterisk for Physical Activities indicates a level up for the
				rating.</xs:documentation>
			<xs:documentation xml:lang="en">For Environmental Conditions, an asterisk indicates that
				the potential condition in a group is limited to some jobs, not the occupation as a
				whole. For example, in 2212.1 Geological and Mineral Technologists, the asterisk for
				Hazards H8* Dangerous locations – indicates that this is a potential hazard for some
				but not all jobs within the group.</xs:documentation>
